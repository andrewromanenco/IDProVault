Single Sign-On is a service that enables SPs to verify the identities of <strong>End Users</strong> by facilitating communication with IdPs. SSO acts as a bridge to decouple SPs and IdPs. This can happen via numerous protocols such as agent-based integrations, direct LDAP integration, SAML, and OpenID Connect, to name a few.
