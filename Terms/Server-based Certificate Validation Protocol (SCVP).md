A protocol that allows a client to query a server to determine whether a certificate is valid and trusted. The server does not need to be associated with the issuing CA. SCVP does two things; (1) it determines the path between the end entity and the trusted root, whereby the client doesn't need to trust any intermediate CAs. (2) it also performs delegated path validation according to policy.
