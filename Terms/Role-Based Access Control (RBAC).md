A pattern of access control system involving sets of static, manual definitions of permissions assigned to “roles”, which can be consistently and repeatably associated with users with common access needs. Role-based access control is a control scheme in which roles are granted to identities, and those roles determine what access to resources those identities should have. Basic roles might be “admin” and “read-only user” – an admin would be able to make changes to a system and a read-only user would only be able to view resources.
